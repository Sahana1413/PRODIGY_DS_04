The data is then preprocessed to clean and prepare it for analysis, including text normalization and tokenization. Sentiment analysis is performed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques or libraries like VADER or TextBlob. Visualizations are created using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn to illustrate sentiment trends over time and across different demographics.
